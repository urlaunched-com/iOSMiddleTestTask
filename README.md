# SwiftUI

In this challenge, you need to create a screen with a list of items and a search field:
  - The network layer should be mocked (a JSON sample is available in the repository files, vendors.json);
  - The search should start automatically after a user has typed at least 3 symbols, with a 0.5-second debouncing period;
  - The items should by filtered by the company_name field.

Nice to have:
  - It would be nice to have pagination logic implemented, with at least 3 pages.
